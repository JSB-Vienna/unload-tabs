<strong>Why</strong> use this add-on and not any of the others that does almost the same?
<ul>
	<li> If you have problems with other add-ons of this kind, maybe this one works for you </li>
	<li> it's extremely small </li>
	<li> it loads only stuff it absolutely has to </li>
	<li> it uses modern APIs and code </li>
	<li> it can be removed without leaving anything behind </li>
</ul>


Some of this add-ons code is taken from <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/bartab-lite-x">BarTab Lite X</a> (with the authors admission).
